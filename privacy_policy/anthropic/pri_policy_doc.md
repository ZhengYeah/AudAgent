# Privacy Policy

Effective October 8, 2025

Anthropic is an AI safety and research company working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and process your personal data when you use our website and other places where Anthropic acts as a *data controller*—for example, when you interact with Claude.ai or other products as a consumer for personal use ("**Services**") or when Anthropic operates and provides our commercial customers and their end users with access to our commercial products, such as the Claude Team plan (“**Commercial Services**”).

## 1. Collection of Personal Data

We collect the following categories of personal data:

### Personal data you provide to us directly

- **Identity and Contact Data:** Anthropic collects identifiers, including your name, email address, and phone number when you sign up for an Anthropic account, or to receive information on our Services. We may also collect or generate indirect identifiers (e.g., “USER12345”).
- **Payment Information:** We shall collect your payment information if you choose to purchase access to Anthropic’s products and services.
- **Inputs and Outputs:** You are able to interact with our Services in a variety of formats, including but not limited to chat, coding, and agentic sessions (**“Prompts”** or **"Inputs"**), which generate responses and actions (**“Outputs”**) based on your Inputs. This includes third-party applications you choose to integrate with our Services. If you include personal data or reference external content in your Inputs, we will collect that information and this information may be reproduced in your Outputs.
- **Feedback on your use of our Services:** We appreciate feedback, including ideas and suggestions for improvement or rating an Output in response to an Input ("**Feedback**"). If you rate an Output in response to an Input—for example, by using the thumbs up/thumbs down icon—we will store the entire related conversation as part of your Feedback. You can learn more about how we use Feedback [here](https://privacy.anthropic.com/en/articles/10023565-how-does-anthropic-use-submitted-feedback).
- **Communication Information:** If you communicate with us, including via our chatbot on our Help site, we collect your name, contact information, and the contents of any messages you send.

### Personal data we receive automatically from your use of the Services

When you use the Services, we also receive certain technical data automatically (described below, collectively “**Technical Information**”). This includes:

- **Device and Connection Information.** Consistent with your device or browser permissions, your device or browser automatically sends us information about when and how you install, access, or use our Services. This includes information such as your device type, operating system information, browser information and web page referers, mobile network, connection information, mobile operator or internet service provider (ISP), time zone setting, IP address (including information about the location of the device derived from your IP address), identifiers (including device or advertising identifiers, probabilistic identifiers, and other unique personal or online identifiers), and device location.

If you or your device experiences an error, we may collect information about the error, the time the error occurred, the feature being used, the state of the application when the error occurred, and any communications or content provided at the time the error occurred.
- **Cookies & Similar Technologies.** We and our service providers use cookies, scripts, or similar technologies (“**Cookies**”) to manage the Services and to collect information about you and your use of the Services. These technologies help us to recognize you, customize or personalize your experience, market additional products or services to you, and analyze the use of our Services to make them safer and more useful to you. For more details about how we use these technologies, and your opt-out controls and other options, please visit our [Cookie Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/cookies).

### Personal data we collect or receive to train our models

Anthropic obtains personal data from third party sources in order to train our models. Specifically, we train our models using data from the following sources:

## 3. How We Disclose Personal Data

- **Affiliates & corporate partners.** Anthropic discloses the categories of personal data described above between and among its affiliates and related entities.
- **Service providers & business partners.** Anthropic may disclose the categories of personal data described above with service providers and business partners for a variety of business purposes, including website and data hosting, ensuring compliance with industry standards, research, auditing, data processing, and providing you with the services.

Anthropic may also disclose personal data in the following circumstances:

- **As part of a significant corporate event.** If Anthropic is involved in a merger, corporate transaction, bankruptcy, or other situation involving the transfer of business assets, Anthropic will disclose your personal data as part of these corporate transactions.
- **Third-Party Websites and Services:** Our Services may involve integrations with, or may direct you to, websites, apps, and services managed by third parties. By interacting with these third parties, you are providing information directly to the third party and not Anthropic and subject to the third party’s privacy policy.If you access third-party services, such as social media sites or other sites linked through the Services (e.g., if you follow a link to our Twitter account), these third-party services will be able to collect personal data about you, including information about your activity on the Services. If we link to a site or service via our Services, you should read their data usage policies or other documentation. Our linking to another site or service doesn’t mean we endorse it or speak for that third party.
- **Pursuant to regulatory or legal requirements, safety, rights of others, and to enforce our rights or our terms.** We may disclose personal data to governmental regulatory authorities as required by law, including for legal, tax or accounting purposes, in response to their requests for such information or to assist in investigations. We may also disclose personal data to third parties in connection with claims, disputes or litigation, when otherwise permitted or required by law, or if we determine its disclosure is necessary to protect the health and safety of you or any other person, to protect against fraud or credit risk, to enforce our legal rights or the legal rights of others, to enforce contractual commitments that you have made, or as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law.
- **With an individual's consent.** Anthropic will otherwise disclose personal data when an individual gives us permission or directs us to disclose this information, including as a part of our Services.

You can find information on our [Subprocessor List](https://www.anthropic.com/subprocessors) about the third parties Anthropic engages to help us process personal data provided to us where Anthropic acts as a data processor, such as with respect to personal data we receive, process, store, or host when you use Anthropic's commercial services.

## 6. Data Retention, Data Lifecycle, and Security Controls

Anthropic retains your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes and criteria outlined in this Privacy Policy and explained further in our [privacy center](https://privacy.anthropic.com/en/articles/10023548-how-long-do-you-store-personal-data).

When the personal data collected is no longer required by us, we and our service providers will perform the necessary procedures for destroying, deleting, erasing, or converting it into an anonymous form as permitted or required under applicable laws.

### Aggregated or De-Identified Information

We may process personal data in an aggregated or de-identified form to analyze the effectiveness of our Services, conduct research, study user behavior, and train our AI models as permitted under applicable laws. For instance:

- When you submit Feedback, we disassociate Inputs and Outputs from your user ID to use them for training and improving our models.
- If our systems flag Inputs or Outputs for potentially violating our [Usage Policy](https://anthropic.com/legal/aup), we disassociate the content from your user ID to train our trust and safety internal classification and generative models. However, we may re-identify the Inputs or Outputs to enforce our Usage Policy with the responsible user if necessary.
- To improve user experience, we may analyze and aggregate general user behavior and usage data. This information does not identify individual users.

### Security Controls Relating to our Processing of Personal Data

We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect personal data from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
